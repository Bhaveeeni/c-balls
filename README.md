A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

Crisp, golden brown, with nuts
Hers are crunchy-brown on the edges and crisp throughout—no gooey center for me—with big chunks of dark chocolate (not waxy milk chocolate), and little bits of toasted, chopped-up walnuts.
